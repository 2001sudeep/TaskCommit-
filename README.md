# Todo App with React

Welcome to my todo app! This project was created using React, a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The goal of this todo app is to provide a simple yet effective way to manage your tasks and stay organized.

## Features

- **Add and Remove Tasks**: Easily add new tasks to your list and remove them when they're completed.
- **Checkboxes**: Mark tasks as complete by checking off their checkboxes.
- **Filtering**: Filter tasks by status (all, completed, active) to focus on what's most important.
- **Local Storage**: Your tasks are saved to local storage, so they'll persist even if you refresh the page or close your browser.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly across devices of all sizes, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend development library for building the user interface and managing state.
- **CSS**: Custom styling using CSS to enhance the app's visual appeal and usability.
- **JavaScript**: Core programming language used for implementing app logic and functionality.

## How to Use

1. **Adding Tasks**: Simply type your task into the input field at the top of the app and press Enter to add it to your list.
2. **Completing Tasks**: Click on the checkbox next to a task to mark it as complete.
3. **Removing Tasks**: Hover over a task and click the delete button (X) to remove it from your list.
4. **Filtering Tasks**: Use the buttons at the bottom of the app to filter tasks by status (all, completed, active).

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the todo app is functional, there's always room for improvement. Some ideas for future enhancements include:

- **Drag-and-Drop**: Add drag-and-drop functionality to reorder tasks within the list.
- **Themes**: Implement different color themes or customization options for users.
- **Collaboration**: Allow multiple users to collaborate on shared todo lists.
- **Notification**: Add notifications for upcoming tasks or reminders.
